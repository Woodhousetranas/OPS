# Order Parsing and Matching Logic Improvements

## Phase 1: Code Analysis and Understanding
- [x] Clone repository
- [x] Examine project structure
- [x] Read and analyze app.py (lines 270, 283, 30, 54-67, 116-141, 173-208, 73-100)
- [x] Read and analyze database.py
- [x] Understand current data flow and architecture

## Phase 2: Core Bug Fixes
- [x] Fix regex patterns for quantity extraction (lines 270, 283)
  - Anchor quantity match to end of line
  - Handle cases like "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm)" correctly
- [x] Fix product_to_article dictionary (line 30)
  - Store list of candidate articles per product
  - Implement fuzzy matching with size/colour token detection
- [x] Fix decimal quantity handling (lines 54-67)
  - Re-run zero check after rounding
  - Reject fractional quantities or flag bad data
- [x] Fix column detection logic (lines 116-141, 173-208)
  - Prefer first strong match
  - Support locale variants
  - Keep alternatives as fallbacks
- [x] Implement caching for db.get_all_products() (lines 73-100)
  - Cache synonym map in memory
  - Refresh only when products change

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- [x] Implement unmatched items tracking
  - Create secondary output (extra worksheet or JSON field)
  - Group by root cause
- [x] Add comprehensive logging system
  - Log parsing/matching decisions with structured metadata
  - Include input fields, regex used, final match
- [x] Implement synonym management
  - Track synonym usage frequency
  - Create endpoint to accept/reject learned aliases
- [x] Add product versioning
  - Implement soft-deletion
  - Keep historical revision info
  - Maintain old order explanations
- [ ] Create inline editing capabilities
  - Allow users to search product catalog
  - Confirm intended items
  - Persist synonyms from same screen
- [x] Integrate all new modules into main app.py
- [x] Update database.py with new tables
- [x] Create API endpoints for new features

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
- [x] Test all bug fixes
- [x] Test new features
