# Order Processing System - Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document details all improvements made to the Order Processing System to address parsing issues, enhance matching logic, and add new features for better order management.

## 1. Core Bug Fixes

### 1.1 Regex Pattern Improvements (Lines 270, 283)

**Problem:** 
- Regex patterns were not anchored to the end of the line
- "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm)" was incorrectly parsed as "Rakza" with quantity 9

**Solution:**
- Implemented `RegexPatterns` class in `parsing_engine.py` with properly anchored patterns
- Added `PRODUCT_QTY_DELIMITED` pattern that anchors quantity to end of line: `r'^(.+?)[,:\s]+(\d+)\s*$'`
- Added delimiter validation to ensure quantity is after the last delimiter
- Prevents numbers within product names from being mistaken for quantities

**Example:**
```python
# Before: "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm)" → Product: "Rakza", Qty: 9
# After:  "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm), 5" → Product: "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm)", Qty: 5
```

### 1.2 Product-to-Article Mapping (Line 30)

**Problem:**
- `product_to_article` dictionary collapsed duplicate product names to single article
- Lost information about product variants with same name

**Solution:**
- Implemented `ProductCache` class in `product_matcher.py`
- Uses `defaultdict(list)` to store multiple articles per product name
- Stores multiple product variants per article number
- Implements token-based disambiguation for variants

**Example:**
```python
# Before: product_to_article["Rubber X"] = "12345" (only one)
# After:  product_to_articles["Rubber X"] = ["12345", "12346", "12347"]
#         article_to_products["12345"] = [{"article": "12345", "name": "Rubber X (Red)"}]
```

### 1.3 Decimal Quantity Handling (Lines 54-67)

**Problem:**
- Decimal quantities were truncated without re-checking for zero
- Values between 0 and 1 could become valid orders with quantity 0

**Solution:**
- Implemented `QuantityValidator` class in `parsing_engine.py`
- Rejects fractional quantities between 0 and 1 outright
- Re-runs zero check after rounding
- Provides detailed warnings for all quantity issues

**Example:**
```python
# Before: 0.5 → rounded to 0 → accepted (invalid!)
# After:  0.5 → rejected with error "Fractional quantity (0.5) between 0 and 1 is invalid"

# Before: 2.7 → rounded to 2 → accepted (no warning)
# After:  2.7 → rounded to 3 → accepted with warning "decimal_rounded: 2.7 → 3"
```

### 1.4 Column Detection Logic (Lines 116-141, 173-208)

**Problem:**
- Detected column was overwritten every time a header matched
- No preference for strong matches vs weak matches

**Solution:**
- Implemented `ColumnDetector` class in `parsing_engine.py`
- Prioritizes strong matches (exact "product", "article", "quantity")
- Keeps weak matches as fallbacks
- Supports locale variants (German: "artikel", "menge", etc.)
- Tracks match strength to prevent overwriting strong matches

**Example:**
```python
# Strong keywords: ['product', 'article', 'quantity']
# Weak keywords: ['description', 'id', 'count']

# Before: Column "Product Description" overwrites "Product" column
# After:  "Product" (strong match) is kept, "Product Description" ignored
```

### 1.5 Product Data Caching (Lines 73-100)

**Problem:**
- `db.get_all_products()` called on every match attempt
- Severe performance issues with large catalogs

**Solution:**
- Implemented `ProductCache` class with thread-safe caching
- Caches all product data, synonyms, and mappings in memory
- Provides `refresh()` method to update cache when products change
- Reduces database calls from O(n) per order to O(1) per batch

**Performance Impact:**
```
Before: 1000 orders × 100 products = 100,000 database queries
After:  1000 orders × 100 products = 1 cache refresh + 1000 lookups
Speedup: ~100x for large catalogs
```

## 2. Enhanced Features

### 2.1 Unmatched Items Tracking

**Implementation:** `unmatched_tracker.py`

**Features:**
- Groups unmatched items by root cause
- Provides detailed suggestions for each unmatched item
- Generates both JSON and text reports
- Tracks items with warnings separately

**Root Causes Tracked:**
- `NO_MATCH_FOUND`: No product found in catalog
- `LOW_MATCH_SCORE`: Match score below threshold
- `INVALID_QUANTITY`: Quantity validation failed
- `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH`: Multiple equally good matches
- `PRODUCT_UNAVAILABLE`: Product exists but unavailable
- `PRODUCT_DISCONTINUED`: Product is discontinued
- `PARSING_ERROR`: Failed to parse input
- `MISSING_DATA`: Required data missing

**Output Files:**
- `order_CUSTOMER_DATE_unmatched.json`: Structured data for programmatic access
- `order_CUSTOMER_DATE_unmatched.txt`: Human-readable report

### 2.2 Comprehensive Logging System

**Implementation:** `parsing_engine.py` - `ParsingAuditor` class

**Features:**
- Logs every parsing/matching decision
- Includes structured metadata:
  - Input fields (original text, product name, article number)
  - Regex pattern used
  - Match method and score
  - Final matched product
  - Warnings and errors
  - Timestamp and context

**Log Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45",
  "input": {
    "original_text": "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm), 5",
    "product_name": "Rakza 9 Black (2.0 mm)",
    "quantity": 5
  },
  "output": {
    "matched_article": "12345",
    "matched_product": "Rakza 9 Black 2.0mm",
    "match_score": 95,
    "match_method": "fuzzy_product_token_enhanced"
  },
  "warnings": [],
  "metadata": {
    "regex_used": "PRODUCT_QTY_DELIMITED"
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Synonym Management

**Implementation:** `product_matcher.py` - `SynonymManager` class

**Features:**
- Automatically suggests synonyms for good fuzzy matches (score 85-99)
- Tracks synonym usage frequency
- Provides endpoints to approve/reject synonyms
- Persists approved synonyms to database
- Refreshes cache after synonym changes

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/synonyms/pending`: Get pending synonym suggestions
- `POST /api/synonyms/approve`: Approve a synonym
- `POST /api/synonyms/reject`: Reject a synonym
- `GET /api/synonyms/statistics`: Get usage statistics

**Workflow:**
1. User enters "TT Rubber" (not in catalog)
2. System fuzzy matches to "Tibhar Rubber" (score: 88)
3. System suggests synonym: "TT Rubber" → "Tibhar Rubber"
4. Admin reviews and approves
5. Future orders with "TT Rubber" match exactly (score: 100)

### 2.4 Product Versioning

**Implementation:** `product_versioning.py` - `ProductVersionManager` class

**Features:**
- Soft deletion (marks as discontinued, keeps data)
- Complete version history for each product
- Explains old orders using historical product state
- Tracks who made changes and why
- Supports product restoration

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE product_versions (
    version_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    article_number TEXT,
    product_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    is_available INTEGER,
    is_discontinued INTEGER,
    synonyms TEXT,
    created_at TEXT,
    updated_at TEXT,
    version_created_at TEXT,
    change_reason TEXT,
    changed_by TEXT
)
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/products/history/<article>`: Get product history
- `POST /api/products/soft-delete`: Soft delete a product
- `POST /api/products/restore`: Restore a product
- `POST /api/products/explain-order`: Explain old order
- `GET /api/products/changelog`: Get recent changes

**Use Case:**
```
Order from 2024-01-15: Article "12345" → "Rubber X Red"
Product updated 2024-06-01: Article "12345" → "Rubber X Red Pro"

Query: Why does old order show "Rubber X Red"?
Answer: Product was renamed on 2024-06-01. At order time (2024-01-15), 
        the product was called "Rubber X Red".
```

### 2.5 Enhanced Product Matching

**Implementation:** `product_matcher.py` - `EnhancedProductMatcher` class

**Matching Strategies (in order):**
1. **Exact Article Match**: Direct article number lookup
2. **Exact Product Match**: Case-insensitive product name match
3. **Synonym Match**: Check known synonyms (score: 100)
4. **Fuzzy Article Match**: Fuzzy match on article numbers (threshold: 85)
5. **Fuzzy Product Match**: Fuzzy match on product names (threshold: 80)
6. **Token-Enhanced Match**: Use size/color tokens to disambiguate

**Token Matching:**
- Extracts size tokens: "2.0 mm", "2.0&quot;", "(2.0)"
- Extracts color tokens: "black", "red", "blue", etc.
- Calculates token similarity for disambiguation
- Combines fuzzy score (70%) + token score (30%)

**Example:**
```
Input: "Rakza 9 Black 2.0"
Candidates:
  - "Rakza 9 Black 2.0mm" (fuzzy: 95, tokens: 100) → combined: 96.5
  - "Rakza 9 Red 2.0mm" (fuzzy: 90, tokens: 50) → combined: 78
Best match: "Rakza 9 Black 2.0mm"
```

## 5. Migration Guide

### 5.1 Switching to Improved Version

**Option 1: Replace Existing (Recommended for new deployments)**
```bash
# Backup original
cp app.py app_original.py

# Use improved version
cp app_improved.py app.py
```

**Option 2: Run Side-by-Side (Recommended for testing)**
```bash
# Run improved version on different port
python app_improved.py  # Port 5000

# Keep original running
python app_original.py --port 5001  # Port 5001
```

### 5.2 Database Migration

The improved version automatically creates new tables on first run:
- `product_versions`: Product version history
- Indexes on `article_number` and `version_created_at`

No manual migration needed - existing data is preserved.
